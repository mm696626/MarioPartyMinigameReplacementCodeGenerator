# MarioPartyMinigameReplacementCodeGenerator
A tool to generate minigame replacement Gecko codes for Mario Parties 4-8

### Mario Party Minigame Replacement Code Generator
* A tool allows you to generate Gecko codes that will replace minigames for Mario Parties 4-8
* This project wouldn't be possible without the Gecko codes bundled with Dolphin

### Why only the GameCube/Wii games?
* I don't play the N64 Mario Parties as much
* Not sure if cheats will work on all N64 emulators/real hardware

### Important Notes
* If you replace minigames like the below example (Booksquirm and Manta Rings would be replaced by Domination, so be careful)
* Manta Rings -> Booksquirm
* Booksquirm -> Domination
**These codes are only for the US version**
