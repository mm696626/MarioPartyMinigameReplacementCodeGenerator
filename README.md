# MarioPartyMinigameReplacementCodeGenerator
A tool to generate minigame replacement cheat codes for Mario Parties 1-8

### Mario Party Minigame Replacement Code Generator
* A tool allows you to generate codes that will replace minigames for Mario Parties 1-8
* This project wouldn't be possible without the cheat codes bundled with Dolphin and Mario Party Netplay

### Replacement Code Sources
* N64 Games (Mario Parties 1-3)
  * https://github.com/MarioPartyNetplay/Mupen-MPN/blob/master/Data/Cheats/Generated/MarioParty.cht
  * https://github.com/MarioPartyNetplay/Mupen-MPN/blob/master/Data/Cheats/Generated/MarioParty2.cht
  * https://github.com/MarioPartyNetplay/Mupen-MPN/blob/master/Data/Cheats/Generated/MarioParty3.cht
* GameCube Games (Mario Parties 4-7)
  * https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Data/Sys/GameSettings/GMPE01.ini
  * https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Data/Sys/GameSettings/GP5E01.ini
  * https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Data/Sys/GameSettings/GP6E01.ini
  * https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Data/Sys/GameSettings/GP7E01.ini
* Wii Games (just Mario Party 8)
  * https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Data/Sys/GameSettings/RM8E01.ini

### Why not Mario Party DS or any games after 8?
* Mario Party DS would only work for singleplayer due to the multiplayer being Download Play only and thus cheats not working
* I wanted to limit this to the classic Mario Party games (all the ones that Hudson Soft worked on)
  * I simply don't have any interest in any of the games after 8, and there's also the fact that cheat codes like this don't even exist for the Mario Party games made after the Wii anyway

### Important Notes
* Any minigame that is selectable in the game's Free Play Mode or is in the standard Party mode is replaceable
* If you replace minigames like the below example (Booksquirm and Manta Rings would be replaced by Domination, so be careful)
* Manta Rings -> Booksquirm
* Booksquirm -> Domination
* **These codes are only for the US version**
